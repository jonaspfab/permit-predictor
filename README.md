Predicting outcome of building permit applications using machine learning techniques

# Description
Building permits have to be obtained for almost all new constructions and demolitions, as well as for certain alterations in order to ensure that land use regulations and building codes are respected. Building permits are a practical ne- cessity in modern cities to control the direction of future developments. However, they represent a financial risk if a permit application is denied. The goal of this project is to minimize this financial risk by building a classifier which can be used to predict whether or not a permit application will be successful. We used the Seattle building permit dataset, which contains around 120,000 permit appli- cation from the last 30 years. Several pre-processing methods were applied, in- cluding under- and over-sampling using SMOTE, before we trained different classifiers with the data. Using a decision tree classifier we were able to achieve an accuracy of 0.7716, a precision of 0.7824, a recall of 0.751, and an F-score of 0.7664.
